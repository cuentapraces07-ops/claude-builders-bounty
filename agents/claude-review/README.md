# Claude PR review agent

This directory contains a dependency-free CLI that fetches a public GitHub PR,
reviews its diff, and emits a structured Markdown report. With
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set it calls `claude-sonnet-4-6`; with no key it
falls back to a deterministic local baseline and labels that mode in the
report. `--offline` disables Anthropic API calls but still fetches the public
GitHub metadata and diff; it is not a network-free mode. The fallback is not
a claim that Claude reviewed the PR.

## Setup and use

The CLI requires Python 3.10+ and has no third-party dependencies. From the
repository root, run:

```bash
python bin/claude-review --pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

This command works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. If embedding the agent in a
different project, preserve the repository layout by copying both
`agents/claude-review/` and `bin/claude-review`; alternatively invoke the
module directly with `python agents/claude-review/claude_review.py --pr ...`.

Optionally set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; add `--output review.md` to save the
report, then inspect it before merging. To publish the generated report as a
top-level PR conversation comment, pass `--post` and provide `GITHUB_TOKEN`
(or `GH_TOKEN`) with repository permission to write issue/PR comments. Posting
is off by default; each use of `--post` creates a public comment and may notify
subscribers.

The client accepts only HTTPS `github.com` pull-request URLs, caps fetched
diffs at 1 MB, and falls back to GitHub's paginated PR-files API if the `.diff`
endpoint fails. If GitHub omits any file patch or the page limit is reached,
the report marks coverage partial and forces confidence to Low. It never
executes the target repository and does not print API keys. The Claude request
is limited to the PR metadata and diff; the repository
is not granted credentials or write access. PR titles, bodies, and diffs are
treated as untrusted data: instructions embedded in a diff are not followed.
The reviewer does not post comments or modify repositories unless the caller
explicitly supplies `--post`; the write request then sends only the rendered
report to the exact PR URL parsed from `--pr`. The local
baseline also flags common destructive shell/SQL patterns such as `rm -rf`,
`git push --force`, `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, and unqualified `DELETE FROM` for
explicit maintainer review.
The baseline also flags common prompt-injection and credential-exfiltration
phrases in PR content so they remain review data rather than instructions.
It also warns when a changed GitHub Actions workflow both runs on `pull_request`
and posts a comment: fork-originated runs commonly receive a read-only
`GITHUB_TOKEN` unless repository or organization settings explicitly allow
write tokens. Verify the fork policy instead of switching to
`pull_request_target` without a separate security review.
Claude's response is parsed as a bounded JSON review: the summary must contain
2–3 sentences, list fields must contain strings, oversized output is rejected,
and invalid responses fall back to a deterministic three-sentence local pass.
Untrusted titles and review prose are flattened and escaped before Markdown
rendering so they cannot add headings, links, or raw HTML to the generated
report.
Claude receives at most 8,000 characters of PR body and 50,000 characters of
diff. If either limit is exceeded, the report marks the review as partial,
states what was omitted, and forces confidence to Low.

## Output contract

Every report uses the four-section contract `Summary`, `Risks`, `Improvement
suggestions`, and `Confidence` (`Low`/`Medium`/`High`). The engine and diff
scope are recorded as metadata so a reviewer can distinguish an API review
from the offline baseline. The CLI emits a report by default. Posting requires
the explicit `--post` flag and a GitHub token; it creates a top-level PR
conversation comment, not an inline review. It never changes source files,
branches, or merge state.

## Claude Code sub-agent

The repository includes an auto-discovered, read-only sub-agent at
`.claude/agents/pr-reviewer.md`. It accepts a single public GitHub PR URL and
fetches only that PR's `.diff` using `WebFetch`; the fetched patch is treated as
untrusted input. Its tool allowlist contains no shell, MCP, or GitHub write
tool, and `permissionMode: plan` keeps it read-only. It returns the same
four-section report, but does not run the CLI, verify CI, or publish comments.

For a deterministic local review with the bundled CLI, use
`python bin/claude-review --pr <url> --offline`. To publish a public comment,
review the generated report first, then explicitly opt in with `--post` and a
GitHub token that can write PR comments; this action is separate from the
read-only sub-agent.

## Tests

Run the standard-library unit tests from the repository root:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s agents/claude-review/tests -v
```

Reproducible reports for two real public pull requests, #4408 and #4409, are
included in `samples/`. They were fetched from GitHub without credentials and
rendered with `--offline`, so they require no Anthropic API key. `--offline`
still needs network access to GitHub; neither target repository was executed.

The original implementation used `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, which Anthropic
retired on June 15, 2026. This implementation uses Anthropic's documented
replacement, `claude-sonnet-4-6`; no live API call is made by the offline
tests.
