- URL: https://github.com/claude-builders-bounty/claude-builders-bounty/pull/41
- Scope: 4 changed file(s), +341/-0
- Engine: local heuristic (no Claude API key)

## Summary

The pull request changes 4 file\(s\), adding 341 line\(s\) and removing 0\. The deterministic baseline scans the fetched diff without executing repository code\. It flags heuristic risks and should be followed by tests and maintainer review\.

## Risks

- A destructive shell or SQL command pattern appears; verify allowlists, explicit confirmation, and safe non\-match tests\.

## Improvement suggestions

- Run the repository's lint, type\-check, and test commands in CI before merging\.

## Confidence

Low
