- URL: https://github.com/claude-builders-bounty/claude-builders-bounty/pull/42
- Scope: 5 changed file(s), +537/-0
- Engine: local heuristic (no Claude API key)

## Summary

The pull request changes 5 file\(s\), adding 537 line\(s\) and removing 0\. The deterministic baseline scans the fetched diff without executing repository code\. It flags heuristic risks and should be followed by tests and maintainer review\.

## Risks

- A destructive shell or SQL command pattern appears; verify allowlists, explicit confirmation, and safe non\-match tests\.
- A credential\-shaped assignment appears in the diff; verify it is not a real secret\.
- SQL is present; verify every value is parameterized and authorization is enforced\.

## Improvement suggestions

- Add focused tests for the highest\-risk paths and consider smaller reviewable commits\.
- Run the repository's lint, type\-check, and test commands in CI before merging\.

## Confidence

Low
