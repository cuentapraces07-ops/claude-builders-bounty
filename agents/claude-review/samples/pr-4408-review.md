- Diff coverage: complete
- Engine: local heuristic (no Claude API key)

## Summary

The pull request changes 6 file&#40;s&#41;, adding 372 line&#40;s&#41; and removing 0. The deterministic baseline scans the fetched diff without executing repository code. It flags heuristic risks and should be followed by tests and maintainer review.

## Risks

- A potentially destructive shell or SQL command pattern matched in added lines; verify allowlists, explicit confirmation, and safe non-match tests. Matching file&#40;s&#41;&#58; hooks/block-destructive-bash/README.md, hooks/block-destructive-bash/block&#95;destructive.py, hooks/block-destructive-bash/examples/blocked.log.sample and 1 more file&#40;s&#41;. This heuristic match is not proof of an exploitable issue; inspect the exact added lines, since detector rules, examples, and fixtures can also match. Matching added lines&#58; hooks/block-destructive-bash/README.md&#58;22, hooks/block-destructive-bash/README.md&#58;23, hooks/block-destructive-bash/README.md&#58;24, hooks/block-destructive-bash/README.md&#58;52, hooks/block-destructive-bash/README.md&#58;53, and 20 more.

## Improvement suggestions
